# todo

- [x] fix markdown display matter
- [x] add "search" in blog page 
- [x] add "sort by time" in blog page
- [ ] ~~add "paginator" for blog page~~ (is it necessary to use paginator while having nested page?)
- [ ] better tag selection page, filtering w/ multi-select

# help

- notion api: [https://developers.notion.com](https://developers.notion.com) 
- notion database id: 
    ``` bash
    # suppose your notion databsae url is "https://www.notion.so/humbornjo/fa0faae85c504934a4a86cfa70302850?v=2abd1079ae134fbd8df2604765baa1df"
    # then your database id is "fa0faae85c504934a4a86cfa70302850"
    ```
